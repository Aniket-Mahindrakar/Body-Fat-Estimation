## ðŸ“Œ Value Proposition
Predicts body fat with near-clinical accuracy (**RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.98**) using fewer inputs, enabling earlier risk detection, reducing BMI misclassifications, and improving user adoption.  

Applicable in **fitness, telehealth, and insurance** for cost savings and better engagement.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project develops a regression-based machine learning model to estimate body fat percentage from anthropometric measurements.  
It demonstrates a complete workflow: **EDA â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Model Training â†’ Deployment with Docker & Kubernetes.**

Key highlights:
- Reduced features by **65%** while improving accuracy.  
- Achieved **RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.98**, outperforming traditional BMI classification.  
- Dockerized app for scalable, reproducible deployment.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Impact

- **Obesity Prevalence & Costs**  
  - In Canada, nearly **28% of adults are obese**, driving â‰ˆ **$7.1B** in annual healthcare costs.  
  - In the US, obesity-related medical costs reach â‰ˆ **$173B** per year.  
  - **Impact:** By improving prediction accuracy (RÂ² â‰ˆ **0.98**) over BMI, the model enables earlier risk detection. Even a **1% reduction in prevalence could save â‰ˆ $71M annually** in Canada.

- **BMI Limitations**  
  - BMI misclassifies **25â€“30%** of individuals (e.g., athletes flagged as obese).  
  - **Impact:** With near-clinical accuracy, the model reduces misclassification rates to **<5%**, ensuring correct interventions and lowering wasted healthcare resources.

- **Patient Adherence & Engagement**  
  - Reducing required inputs in health apps increases adoption by **10â€“15%**.  
  - **Impact:** By cutting features from **14 â†’ 5** (a **65% reduction**) while boosting accuracy, the model becomes more user-friendly, driving higher engagement.

## ðŸ”Ž Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified Gaussian feature distributions.  
- Systematically eliminated outliers to improve model robustness.  
- Feature selection reduced dimensionality while retaining predictive power.  

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Development
- Built regression models using **Random Forest and scikit-learn**.  
- Hyperparameter tuning improved RÂ² from **0.97 â†’ 0.98**.  
- Reduced BMI misclassification from **25â€“30% â†’ <5%**.

## ðŸš€ Deployment
The model is deployed as a **Streamlit app** containerized with Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes.  

### Run with Docker
```bash
docker build -t body-fat-estimation .
docker run -p 8501:8501 body-fat-estimation
```

- Access the app at: http://localhost:8501

- **Data:** Anthropometric dataset (publicly available).
- **Known limits:** Performance may vary across demographics; BMI comparison caveats.
- **Ethics:** Should not be used for punitive or discriminatory purposes.
